# tcp-reverse-proxy

This is a reverse proxy program based on the TCP protocol, used to map the ports of an intranet application to the public network. If you need to access a website running within a local area network on the Internet, you can use this program to achieve that.

# For example

At the first, you need to have a Linux or Windows server with a public IP address, Assuming the IP is "9.9.9.9", Run the following code on the server:

```
tcprp WAN -b :3390
```

Next, on your internal application server, Assuming the IP is "192.168.9.9" (or another server that can directly access your application server), run the following code.

```
tcprp LAN -a 127.0.0.1:80 -s 9.9.9.9:3390 -o 80
```

Finally, you can access the website at http://9.9.9.9:80 from anywhere (a computer with internet access) to reach http://192.168.9.9:80.

The process is as followsï¼š

1. The server (WAN) listens on a port (-b :3390) to accept requests from clients (LAN) for forwarding

2. The client connects to server bind port (-s 9.9.9.9:3390) on the server and sends a binding request to the port for binding to open port (-o 80)

3. The client establishes a forwarding connection from the application port (-a 127.0.0.1:80) to the server (-o 80)

4. When the user requests the server open port (-o 80), the request is forwarded to the application port (-a 127.0.0.1:80) port
